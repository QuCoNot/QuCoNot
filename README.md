# QuCoNot ðŸ¥¥

**QuCoNoT** contains an implementations of the verifications procedures for implementation of permutation matrices from the paper `Classification and transformations of quantum circuit decompositions for  permutation operations' available at [arXiv](). The details on how to use the verifications methods can be found in the jupyter notebook quconot.ipynb in the repository, where we try this for a few existing and implemented by us decomposition of Multi-Controlled Toffoli
